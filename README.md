# Flow Measurement Device using Arduino and Hall Flow Sensor

The Flow Measurement Device is an Arduino-based project that enables the measurement of fluid flow using a hall flow sensor. This device is designed to accurately measure and monitor the flow rate of liquids or gases in various applications.

## How it works

The device utilizes a hall flow sensor, which generates electrical pulses in response to the flow of fluid. These pulses are counted by the Arduino microcontroller, allowing for the calculation of flow rate. The code provided sets up an interrupt routine that increments a frequency variable whenever a pulse is detected by the hall flow sensor.

## Hardware Setup

To build this project, connect the hall flow sensor to pin 2 (or any other digital pin) of the Arduino board. Make sure to provide power and ground connections as required by the sensor.

## Software Setup

The Arduino code provided initializes the necessary variables and sets up the interrupt routine to count the pulses from the flow sensor. The frequency of pulses is measured over a one-second interval, and the flow rate is calculated based on the measured frequency.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE or a compatible serial communication program.
3. Observe the real-time clock frequency and flow rate displayed in the Serial Monitor.

Please note that the calibration of the flow sensor may be required to obtain accurate flow rate measurements specific to your application.

This project provides a foundation for building a flow measurement system using an Arduino and a hall flow sensor. It can be further extended and integrated into larger projects or systems that require precise flow rate monitoring.
